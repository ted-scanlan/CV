# Ted Scanlan #

======

Some notes about me:

* I'm a full-stack junior software developer, recently graduated from Makers Academy, and equipped with a relevant set of skills and a newfound ability to pick up any tech or language you throw at me!

* Working as a research analyst for 18 months, and then a data analyst for a further 6 months, I built a solid foundation of analytical knowledge. After taking a temporary role in a television company, I realised my interests truly lay somewhere more technical and unambiguous. And then I discovered coding..

* For me, Software Development hits the right spot between analytical and creative thinking, and I enjoy the imaginativeness that it requires. I get a real kick out of making things, and even more so when those things are, or could be, useful to other people.

* I am London based and currently seeking a role where I can get stuck in, learn as much as possible, and contribute to some interesting projects.

### How I work:
<br>

**Team player**

Working with other people exposes you to new ideas and approaches, and everyone I have met on my journey into software development so far has bought different things to the table.

I worked in pairs and groups during my time at Makers Academy. For our <a href="https://github.com/ted-scanlan/strawberry-alarm-clock" target="blank">alarm clock project</a>, for example, we employed Agile approaches such as regular stand-ups/ code reviews, sprints, continuous delivery and collaboration.

**Fast learner**

Software development is a constantly evolving field, and there is always something new and exciting to learn. Whether it be a new technology ( React Native), a new concept or a new problem, I am quick to pick up on things. I am currently at the research and planning stage of a personal project, where I hope to  use geofencing and image recognition of buildings (using python and openCV) to create virtual tour guide through camera phones!


**Attention to detail**

From creating accurate and reliable economic forecasts in my previous career, to scouring lines of code trying to fix a bug during a team project at Makers Academy, attention to detail is a fundamental part of the way I work.
